# Walnut-Engine

My second approach to a C ++ Game Engine to become more familiar with the language. Normally I focus more on gameplay, but I wanted to try something new for C ++.

## Installing

1. Initialize all Submodules
2. Run the "GenerateSolution.bat" file to generate a Visual Studio Solution
3. Open up the Solution
4. Run!
